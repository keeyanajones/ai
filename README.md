Artificial Intelligence 
## what does it do
 Intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. In this case the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

## quick start
Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before

or

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

…or create a new repository on the command line

<pre>
echo "# ai" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/ai.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>                

…or push an existing repository from the command line

<pre>
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/ai.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>

…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
ProTip! Use the URL for this page when adding GitHub as a remote.
